# Task List

## About the Project

**Task List** is a modern and responsive to-do list application built with React and TypeScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently with an intuitive and accessible interface.

The application provides core features such as:

- Adding, completing, and filtering tasks by status (All, Active, Completed)
- Drag-and-drop reordering of tasks for better organization
- Real-time updates using local state management with React hooks
- A clean and mobile-first UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Accessibility enhancements with ARIA attributes and keyboard support
